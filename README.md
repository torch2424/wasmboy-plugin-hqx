# wasmboy-plugin-hqx
Plugin for WasmBoy to add support for hqx upscaling. Built with Rust for WebAssembly.

# Contributing

Depends on the `hqx` crate, within [wasmboy-rs](https://github.com/CryZe/wasmboy-rs).

Started by following the Rust Book [Hello World](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/game-of-life/hello-world.html). Generated partially using the [wasm-pack-template](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template). And `www/` generated with the [create-wasm-app](https://github.com/rustwasm/create-wasm-app).
