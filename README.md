Plugin for WasmBoy to add support for hqx upscaling. Built with Rust for WebAssembly.

# Contributing

Depends on the `hqx` crate, within [wasmboy-rs](https://github.com/CryZe/wasmboy-rs).

Scaffolded follwing the [wasm-pack npm package guide](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/book/tutorials/npm-browser-packages/index.html).
